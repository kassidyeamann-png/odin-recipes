    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p1>While everyone loves a classic chocolate chip cookie, once you add salt to the top, the become the ultimate dessert! Even though these cookies are made entirely from scratch, they really don't take very long at all!  Yes, there is some chilling timeâ€¦ but that's not hands on, so you have some down time.</p1>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 cup salted butter <em>at room temperature</em> 1 stick</li>
            <li>1/2 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/3 cup + 2 tsp granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 large egg <em>at room temperature</em></li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
            <li>sea salt flakes</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add flour and baking soda to a mixing bowl and whisk for 15 seconds to incorporate and make them fluffy.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl that's compatible with a stand mixer (or you can use a regular mixing bowl and use a hand mixer), add softened butter and both sugars. Beat with paddle attachment for about 2 minutes, until mixture is smooth and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Add egg and vanilla, beat on LOW speed until combined.</li>
            <li>Add flour, half the mixture at a time, beating on LOW speed until JUST combined after each addition. Don't overmix, or your cookies won't be soft and tender.</li>
            <li>Add chocolate chips and stir together with a wooden spoon.</li>
            <li>Cover bowl and chill for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Minutes before you want to bake, preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.</li>
            <li>Use a large cookie scoop (or a 1/4 cup filled about 2/3 of the way), scoop round balls of dough onto parchment paper about 2 inches apart. I baked 6 cookies per sheet.</li>
            <li>Press a couple chocolate chips into the tops of the balls of dough, and bake about 10-12 minutes, or until edges are lightly golden brown and tops of cookies look a little underdone. (mine took 11 minutes).</li>
            <li>Sprinkle top of baked cookies with some sea salt flakes.</li>
            <li>Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack to finish cooling.</li>

        </ol>
