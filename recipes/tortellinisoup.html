<h2>Description</h2>

<p1>I'm a big fan of dinners like this tortellini soup that you can make ahead of time, or throw together in 30 minutes, right before you're ready to eat. That way I can buy what I need, and depending on how my days goes, I can start prepping it in the morning. Or if I don't get to it early, I know it will be easy to throw together at dinnertime. This recipe was inspired by my Creamy Tomato and Spinach Tortellini pasta that has been so popular.
